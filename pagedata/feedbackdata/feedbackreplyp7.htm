    This message should not be opened but deleted. If the sender was really Western, the email would be <strong>harrisonr@western.com, not westernabc.net. </strong>This is a common hoax to get personal information by using an email address similar to the companyâ€™s address and subject line <strong>Important 401(k) Information</strong> looks suspicious.
