            You regularly clean out your recently deleted folder as well as your Trash and Spam folders and you keep a
            private email account separate from your business account, so you donâ€™t have any folders that do not
            contain business messages.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Open, read, and close each message that you want to keep. You may read any email message before deciding,
            but truly suspicious email messages should be deleted without opening them. Look for clues in the email
            address and/or subject lines. For this activity, please delete only one at a time.
